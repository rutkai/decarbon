<p>
    A 3<sup>rd</sup> generation power train development can only start upon the experiences first and second generation development.
    The 3<sup>rd</sup> generation vehicle power train can work both with internal combustion and electronic power sources.
    This is also a technology that requires more complex and longer development and the maximum efficiency of parts is also necessary here.
    It is probable that this technology would provide the greatest efficiency but as there are too many unknown factors as of yet it would be too soon to declare so.
    At this point in time the only realistic developments would be those that aim for zero CO<sub>2</sub> emission.
