    <h4 class="title">The main advantages of 1<sup>st</sup> generation power trains</h4>
    <!--<span class="small-text custom-primary">Start your business venture</span>-->
</div>
<ul class="regular-list">
    <li>small weight and volume</li>
    <li>easy to design and easily produced</li>
    <li>scaled to be robust it provides a lasting error-free operation</li>
    <li>in case of internal combustion engines it provides a 9-15% energy efficiency â€“ in other words it reduces CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 9-15%</li>
    <li>enables fast and risk-free deployment</li>
    <li>can be easily fitted with other modern power trains</li>
    <li>in addition to its favourable Co2 emission it increases the dynamic of the vehicle, thus providing a better driving experience</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The goal of the development was to reduce the disadvantages of internal combustion engines as compared to an electronic engine.
</p>
<p>Possible future developments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Low emission diesel engine</li>
</ul>
