    This project focuses on energy-efficient building technologies.
    The energy efficiency project is related to the heating and cooling of larger building blocks which is developed based on expected needs.
    Fast and flexible operational corrections and the reduction of operational cost are important factors in this sector
    – which will only increase in the future, thus necessitating development.
