<p>
    We have plans for improving energy-efficiency in the field of agriculture as well which would only require an external need and/or a cooperating partner to kick off.
    Our plan is not based on digitalization, but rather on the development and modification of technology in an energy-efficient way.
    In addition to energy-efficiency there can also be product and production development based on the needs of the market.

<h3>Drying technology for plants with varying wetness</h3>
<p>Additional development plans:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drying technology for plants with high wetness, for e.g. lucerne.</li>
    <li>Highly energy efficient drying technology.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Efficient wine grapes processing technology</h3>
<p>Additional development plans:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Process for production of grape and wine based products.</li>
</ul>
