<p>
    There are multiple factors whose simultaneous effect might prompt such a project in the future.
    The development rate of our current solar energy system is expected to provide cheap daytime electricity.
    Related industries are developing technologies designed to enhance productivity and a wide-spread interaction between the developments of various other industries is to be expected as well.
    All of the above and many more factors will challenge development engineers in new ways – to which we would like to conform.
