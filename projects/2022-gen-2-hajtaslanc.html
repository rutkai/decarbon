<p>
    This development may be started after the 1<sup>st</sup> generation power train's development had been finished and would still be largely concerned with internal combustion engines.
    This technology requires a more complex and longer development process which would incorporate knowledge and experience from previous developments.
    Its complexity also means that the first ones to implement it would gain a competitive advantage.
    The requirement will be that the applied machine parts should exhibit a near maximum efficiency in which case CO<sub>2</sub> emission should be reduced by 20-30% while maintaining its original dynamic.
