                        My name is Sándor Török, senior development engineer at Decarbon Tech.
                        I have worked in the field of energy efficiency development since 1980.
                        This long career path has lead to dozens of patents and a curious milestone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I experienced already in the first few years as a colleague at the Institute of Energy Management
                        that correct calculations and measured results match completely.
                        Energy efficiency developments save energy and cost,
                        they are environmentally friendly which makes them the path to the future.
                        Only those developments will bring market success which can be produced and maintained in a cost efficient way.
                        I arrived at a special milestone in 2004 when a Californian company asked me to develop a patent portfolio.
                        This was when I experienced that such a task requires an extraordinary performance.
                        The fast changing pace of our world nowadays necessitates fast and flexible responses
                        and strategic thinking which have become my compass.
